#Spatial Analysis on Karnataka#
This project aims to conduct spatial analysis on water bodies in Karnataka, India, using geospatial data and machine learning techniques.

Overview
The goal of this project is to analyze the spatial distribution of water bodies across different regions in Karnataka and identify potential hotspots. The analysis includes the following key components:

Data Collection: Gathering geospatial data related to water bodies, including their locations, types, and other relevant attributes.

Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and preprocessing the collected data to remove inconsistencies and prepare it for analysis.

Spatial Analysis: Using geospatial analysis techniques to visualize the distribution of water bodies on maps, identify clusters or hotspots, and explore patterns of distribution.

Hotspot Prediction: Implementing machine learning algorithms, such as K-means clustering or DBSCAN, to predict hotspots of water bodies based on spatial attributes.

Project Structure
The project is structured as follows:

Data: Contains the datasets used for the analysis, including shapefiles, CSV files, or other geospatial data formats.

Notebooks: Jupyter notebooks or Python scripts used for data preprocessing, spatial analysis, and hotspot prediction.

Models: Trained machine learning models for hotspot prediction, if applicable.

Reports: Documentation, reports, or presentations summarizing the analysis and findings.
